    Purpose:
        Generate all the risk metrics for a single finding and produce aggregate
        organizational risk reports.

    Steps/Logic:
        - Determine risk level using determine_finding_severity.
        - Calculate financial impact based on compliance framework (PCI, SOC2, or default).
        - Calculate remediation cost (calculator.calculate_remediation_cost).
        - Calculate ROI (calculator.calculate_roi).
        - Calculate risk score using _calculate_risk_score.
        - Generate business impact narrative (_generate_business_impact).
        - Assess customer impact (_assess_customer_impact).
        - Estimate remediation time (_estimate_remediation_time).
        - Returns a RiskMetrics object containing all above metrics.

    Private Helper Methods:
        _calculate_risk_score:
            Converts enum + finding info into 0-100 risk score.
            Adjusts for critical services and keywords in description.
        _generate_business_impact:
            Converts risk & service into a narrative statement for executives.
        _assess_customer_impact:
            Short summary of potential impact to customers based on severity.
        _estimate_remediation_time:
            Maps risk level to expected days to remediate.

    Syntax Notes:
        - "_" prefix → private/internal method convention in Python.
        - Dictionary lookups often use .get() with defaults.

    Aggregate Methods:
        calculate_aggregate_risk:
            Loops through all findings, calculates metrics, sums financial impact,
            and produces overall organizational risk score.
        _determine_overall_risk_level:
            Converts overall score into textual risk levels (CRITICAL, HIGH, MODERATE…).
        _identify_top_risks:
            Returns the top N findings by financial impact.

    ROI Prioritization:
        prioritize_remediation_by_roi:
            Sorts findings by ROI score to show quick wins first.
            Returns a list of dictionaries with ROI info, remediation cost,
            days to remediate, and business impact.

    Executive Summary Generation:
        generate_executive_summary:
            Aggregates all metrics into a structured dictionary.
            Includes:
                - headline → attention-grabbing summary
                - risk_posture → overall risk description
                - financial_exposure → total exposure and ranges
                - key_metrics → counts of findings by severity
                - strategic_recommendations → actionable recommendations
                - quick_wins → top high-ROI findings
                - top_5_risks → largest financial exposures
                - remediation_roadmap → phased remediation plan
                - compliance_status → overall compliance posture

        Helper Methods:
            _generate_executive_headline, _generate_strategic_recommendations,
            _generate_remediation_roadmap, _assess_compliance_status,
            _recommend_audit_timing all support executive reporting.

    Export Methods:
        export_executive_report:
            Saves summary as JSON.
        export_markdown_report:
            Saves summary as Markdown with tables, headings, and formatted financials.
